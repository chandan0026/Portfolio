## Portfolio Projects

## Puma Sales Data Analysis

**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/chandan0026/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/puma_data.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze real-world retail data from Puma, uncover key drivers of sales and profitability, and generate insights that can influence pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions.

**Description:** This project dives deep into a structured dataset of 9,648 Puma sales transactions. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, I examined pricing patterns, sales volumes, profitability, and operational anomalies. The analysis was enriched with business-oriented commentary to bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

**Skills/Tools/Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Hypothesis, Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA.

**Results:** 
* Top 25% of transactions generated over $150K in revenue, while the bottom 25% fell below $4,200 â€” revealing a massive disparity in customer impact.
* Profit margins ranged from 10% to 80%, signaling both high-efficiency deals and underperforming SKUs.
* 0-unit transactions flagged as potential returns or cancellations, suggesting areas for operational review.
* Price sweet spot identified at $35â€“$55/unit, covering 50% of product sales â€” a goldmine for pricing strategy.
* Bulk orders exceeding 1,200 units in a single transaction revealed high-value clients worth targeting.

## Banking Database Design and Analysis

**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/chandan0026/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/banking%20-%20project.sql)

**Goal:** To build a robust SQL-based banking system to simulate customer, account, and transaction data â€” enabling structured storage, secure relationships, and meaningful financial insights.

**Description:** This project involved designing and implementing a complete relational schema for a retail bank using SQL. The system supports real-world banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, and transaction logging. Additionally, advanced SQL queries were used to generate insights into customer activity, account balances, transaction volumes, and more.

**Skills/Tools/Technology:** Database, MySQL, EDA, Window Fuctions (Rank, Row_Number, Dense_Rank, Lah, etc)

**Results:** 

*Customer Activity Analysis:*
  * Identified top 10 customers by highest total account balance â€” valuable for priority customer programs.
  * Detected customers with multiple accounts, enabling potential cross-selling of services (e.g., loans, investments).

*Account Health & Usage:*
  * Found that over 20% of accounts were inactive or closed, suggesting opportunities for reactivation campaigns or churn analysis.
  * Queried accounts with zero balance and no recent transactions, pointing to dormant accounts needing follow-up.

*Transaction Trends:*
  * Analyzed monthly transaction volumes â€” revealed spikes during payday periods and year-end, highlighting customer spending behavior.
  * Calculated average transaction amount per account type (savings vs current) â€” useful for fee structure and product strategy.

*Operational Insights:*
  * Flagged accounts with frequent large debit transactions â€” could indicate high-risk behavior or business account usage.
  * Determined accounts opened but never funded, allowing the bank to take preventive measures against fraud or system misuse

## Olist Store Analysis

**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/chandan0026/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Olist%20Store%20Analysis.pdf) 

*Dataset:* Olist Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset (2016â€“2018)

**Goal:** To analyze the performance of Olist's online marketplace operations by exploring order volume, sales revenue, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and seller behavior. The dashboard provides actionable insights for stakeholders to improve logistics, customer experience, and sales strategy.

**Skills/Tools/Technology:** Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling, Data Visualization

**Insights:**

*ðŸ“¦ Order and Delivery Overview:*
  * Found that over 20% of accounts were inactive or closed, suggesting opportunities for reactivation campaigns or churn analysis.
  * Queried accounts with zero balance and no recent transactions, pointing to dormant accounts needing follow-up.
