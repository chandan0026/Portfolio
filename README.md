## Portfolio Projects

## Puma Sales Data Analysis

**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/chandan0026/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/puma_data.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze real-world retail data from Puma, uncover key drivers of sales and profitability, and generate insights that can influence pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions.

**Description:** This project dives deep into a structured dataset of 9,648 Puma sales transactions. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, I examined pricing patterns, sales volumes, profitability, and operational anomalies. The analysis was enriched with business-oriented commentary to bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

**Skills/Tools/Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Hypothesis, Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA.

**Results:** 
* Top 25% of transactions generated over $150K in revenue, while the bottom 25% fell below $4,200 — revealing a massive disparity in customer impact.
* Profit margins ranged from 10% to 80%, signaling both high-efficiency deals and underperforming SKUs.
* 0-unit transactions flagged as potential returns or cancellations, suggesting areas for operational review.
* Price sweet spot identified at $35–$55/unit, covering 50% of product sales — a goldmine for pricing strategy.
* Bulk orders exceeding 1,200 units in a single transaction revealed high-value clients worth targeting.

## Banking Database Design and Analysis

**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/chandan0026/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/banking%20-%20project.sql)

**Goal:** To build a robust SQL-based banking system to simulate customer, account, and transaction data — enabling structured storage, secure relationships, and meaningful financial insights.

**Description:** This project involved designing and implementing a complete relational schema for a retail bank using SQL. The system supports real-world banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, and transaction logging. Additionally, advanced SQL queries were used to generate insights into customer activity, account balances, transaction volumes, and more.

**Skills/Tools/Technology:** Database, MySQL, EDA, Window Fuctions (Rank, Row_Number, Dense_Rank, Lah, etc)

**Results:** 

*Customer Activity Analysis:*
  * Identified top 10 customers by highest total account balance — valuable for priority customer programs.
  * Detected customers with multiple accounts, enabling potential cross-selling of services (e.g., loans, investments).

*Account Health & Usage:*
  * Found that over 20% of accounts were inactive or closed, suggesting opportunities for reactivation campaigns or churn analysis.
  * Queried accounts with zero balance and no recent transactions, pointing to dormant accounts needing follow-up.

*Transaction Trends:*
  * Analyzed monthly transaction volumes — revealed spikes during payday periods and year-end, highlighting customer spending behavior.
  * Calculated average transaction amount per account type (savings vs current) — useful for fee structure and product strategy.

*Operational Insights:*
  * Flagged accounts with frequent large debit transactions — could indicate high-risk behavior or business account usage.
  * Determined accounts opened but never funded, allowing the bank to take preventive measures against fraud or system misuse
